      <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp! At the end of July 2020, I'll be
        certified as a full-stack software developer! I'm from Charlottesville, Va. I love to travel, paint, listen to
        music and podcasts, workout (sometimes), and of course Netflix. I want to become a software developer, because
        I’ve always been fascinated by learning about new technologies and ideas. With the way the world is shaping, I
        feel like if we aren’t up to speed with advancements in technology, then we won’t have a bigger understanding of
        the world changing around us. Software Development is a limitlessly expanding field and will keep evolving
        throughout the future. At the end of the program, I would definitely want to start my career in software
        development. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of as many opportunities help advance my career.
        Eventually, I would love to work for a music streaming company like Tidal or Spotify or either with a startup
        company.
